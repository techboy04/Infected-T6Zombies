# Infected
Avoid getting infected by zombies, once you get infected you gotta race to the cure skull before time runs out. This mechanic is based off and improved upon by The Advanced Warfare Zombies Infected type.
After a certain round (by default, 15), Zombies will have a chance to infect you (by default, 60%) to accomidate for a lack of Zombie types.
Every time you get hit after you become infected, the time goes down.
When time reaches zero, you are downed.
